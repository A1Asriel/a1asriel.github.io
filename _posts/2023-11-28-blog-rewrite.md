Obviously, I haven't been very diligent in creating frequent blog posts. Therefore, the main focus of the website will shift from being a blog to becoming a platform for showcasing my projects and portfolio. In order to achieve this, I will develop a custom theme that is more suitable for this type of website. This will not only improve the overall appearance but also add a touch of originality to this space. I have recently been practicing some web development skills, particularly making websites with Jekyll, so this task will be much easier for me now.

The deadline is, as usual, never, but I will attempt to finish the update as soon as possible. See you in the future!
