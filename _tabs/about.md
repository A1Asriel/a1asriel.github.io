## About the website

*I'm not sure how did you find this place, but since you did, welcome!*  
I created this website to help you learn something interesting (or not) about me. You can get all the essential information about me on this page, or check the [links at the bottom](#links) in case if you just want to contact me. While this page provides you some general facts from my life, the blog posts will be bringing my voice into the public with more limited scope, yet detailed thoughts.

## Bio

My name is Asriel or, as my friends call me more often, Azzy; I also go by Alt. I'm a second-year university student who is studying software engineering.  
My hobbies are programming, text roleplaying, and a lil' bit of gaming. I used to play a lot, but now I can't say I'm a real gamer, rather just admiring video games as a culture.  
I stan for free and open-source software *(although still using that frickin' glassy piece of proprietary blob named Microsoft Шindoшs)*, enjoy skeuomorphic design languages like Windows Aero (not extremely plain modern ones are also good, Fluent Design for instance) and love retrocomputing in general.  
*Yeah, I hate and love Windows at the same time.*

I can code in Python almost fluently, have little experience with C# and Lua, and currently trying to learn HTML/CSS/JS. Also considering learning either C or Rust.  
Occasionally I draw things that pop up in my head, but this piece will tell you their average quality:  
![Poorly drawn Asriel in Among Us style with a white soul](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/713481949896900622/1013586971249082418/asrielus.png){: width="200" style="max-width: 100%" }
*yes, this was drawn in MS Paint*

I wish I could draw better, but I'm too lazy to learn it.

My favourite video games (or simply games I still play sometimes) are:

- Deltarune and Undertale,
- Minecraft (best below 1.9, acceptable prior to 1.19.1),
- C&C: Renegade,
- Half-Life/Portal series,
- World of Tanks.
